<!--FAQ for Team-->

## FAQ
Question | Answer
------------ | -------------
| How I do this? | Just pull down and run index.html with live server. |
Why no server? | Because it's due monday and ain't no body got time for that right now with midterms, covid and etc.
You want server. | Yes, I do. I'll probably implement it later with MongoDB or Sequelize. (John will huant me if I don't learn Sequelize)
| Why pages recreate? | I want to get some commits in, and I notice all the points are weighed on HTML and CSS only... I don't know if I'll get much points if I just do backend.
You do logo!?|Yes... give me time. Might just roll with a gamepad for now, but it'll get done.
