# Alfys Coding Cave
Don't touch..... 


# How I do this?

Just pull down and run with live server.

# Why no server?

Because it's due monday and ain't no body got time for that right now with midterms, covid and etc.

# You want server.

Yes, I do. I'll probably implement it later with MongoDB or Sequelize

# Why pages recreate?

I want to get some commits in, and I notice all the points are weighed on HTML and CSS only... I don't know if I'll get much points if I just do backend.
