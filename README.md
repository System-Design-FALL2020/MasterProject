# MasterProject
Our teams overall master project. For this site, we've decided to go for a videogame store with the added twist of allowing you to stream your games from the cloud directly to your chosen platform. When you sign up, you'll be granted access to a vast and exhaustive library of games as well as additional content. Users will be able to download and play whatever games they choose as well as any additional content for those games at only a small additional monthly charge. With our service, our goal is to become your new home for all of your gaming needs.
