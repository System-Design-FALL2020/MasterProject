                <h1>About Us</h1>
                <p>The gaming industry is evolving at a rapid pace. People are looking for new ways to play the games they love. In today’s world where technology is so advanced and widely available, it is clear that there is a strong opportunity to profit from this growth while being fair to the consumer as well as the companies that develop gaming technology. Being a newly growing market, we believe this would provide an excellent business opportunity and would like to offer a solution to take advantage of it.   
                    While companies like Netflix, Hulu, HBO, Showtime, and even Disney have all shown innovation in the video streaming market, none of them offer a solution to the gamer, the ones who immerse themselves in the virtual world and story of a videogame. We believe that we can provide that solution. However, our aim is slightly different. We want to provide consumers the games they love that they can stream and play anytime, anywhere. No need to wait, no need for burst payments because companies decided
                    this was the best year to sell the new Zelda, the new Gears of Wars, or the new Sims. Team C3PO – Consider Three Perfect Opportunities, wants to provide the users the three perfect opportunities our service has to offer. Those are, Pay, Stream, and Play. We want to support every company regardless of the type of game they make that you enjoy and regardless of which console system you play on. No more limited access because you can only afford a select few, instead experience everything from
                    indie low budget games to triple A. Truly an all in one, all access experience. With our service, you'll be able to play alone or with your friends in the games you love most, all in one place. For a low cost of $25 a month you’ll have access to every single game on whichever console you choose to play on. Our next option would be the premium membership of $100 a year! With this subscription, members have access to everything offered in the standard subscription, plus additional DLC released for
                    their favorite games for that year. Enjoy your games as they were meant to be played; no more paywalls and no more choosing what you want to play and missing out on great titles. Companies will be driven to create great content which in return will increase their stream value and revenue. This is how we plan to “change the game!” </p>
